# Kleene Regular Expressions with Rigging, in Haskell

This variant takes the RiggedRegex (Version 02) and provides a third
Semiring, `Semiring Set String`.  `Zero` is the empty set, `One` is a
set with an empty string, `Add` is union and `Mul` is the cartesian
concatenation of the tuples generated by the cartesian product.  The
`sym` function is now modified to return `Zero` on failure, or on
success a Set containing the recognized character as a string.

The union of a any set with the empty set is the set; the cartesian
product of any set with the empty set is the empty set; the
concatenation of the empty string with any set of strings is that set of
strings, so the Semiring properties hold.

The result is a regular expression engine that returns all possible
unique sets of strings that resulted from matching the regular
expression, or the empty set if no match happened.

I'm not yet comfortable with the theoretical underpinnings of this 
variant, but I'm reading intensely to see where I can land this.
