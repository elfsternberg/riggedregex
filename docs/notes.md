Owens and Reppy did a much better job than I originally thought. They
use the tilde to mean "is recognized by," as in "r ~ u" means "`r`
*recognizes* the string `u`".

Following on the nullability issue, r ~ Œµ ‚áî ŒΩ(r) = Œµ, r ~ aw ‚áî Œ¥(a)r ~ w
(`r` recognizes `aw` if the derivative of r with respect to `a`
recognizes only `w`).

r ‚â° s (r is equivalent to s) if ùìõ‚ü¶r‚üß = ùìõ‚ü¶s‚üß.  Note that this is
"equivalance" under set theory, where given a binary equivalence
operation.  That is, if the elements of some set S have an equivalence
notion, then the set S can be split into *equivalence classes*. 

1. At each step we have a residual regular expression `r` for the
   residual string `s`
   
2. Instead of computing the derivative on the fly, we precompute the
   derivative of `r` for each symbol in our alphabet `Œ£`, thereby
   constructing a DFA for the language in `r`.
   
3. Computing equivalence can be expensive

4. It is not practical to iterate over every Unicode codepoint for
   each state.
   
5. A scanner-generator takes a collection of REs, not just one.

Owens & Reppy introduce a notion of *weak equivalence*, which is a set
of rules for harmonizing some regular expression equivalents.  These
look a lot like some of the performance optimizations found in Might &
Adams.

They define a *class*, **S**, where **S** ‚äÜ Œ£.  **S** covers both the
empty set and the single character set, as well as a multi-character
*class*.

They then add equivalence expressions: **R** + **S** ‚âà **T** where 
T = R ‚à™ S. (Note that this works for *recognition*.  But what about more
complex operations?)

We say that a and b are equivalent in r only if Œ¥(a)r ‚â° Œ¥(b)r.

r = a + b ¬∑ a + c

(Do we read this "a OR ba OR c" or "(a or b)(a or c)".  If we read it
the first way, then this makes sense: the equivalence classes for r
produce three possible derivatives: {a, c}, transition to `Œµ`; {b},
transition to `a`; or Œ£\{a,b,c}, which is the alphabet that excludes a,
b, or c, and transitions to `‚äò`.)

All right, having gotten that out of the way, we say that i ‚âÖ·µ£ j (the
derivative class of r(i) is equivalent to the derivative class of r(j))
if `Œ¥·µ¢r ‚â° Œ¥‚±ºr`.

fun goto q (S, (Q, Œ¥)) =
	let c ‚àà S
	let q c = ‚àÇ c q
	in
		if ‚àÉq 0 ‚àà Q such that q 0 ‚âà q c
			then (Q, Œ¥ ‚à™ {(q, S) 7‚Üí q 0 })
			else
				let Q 0 = Q ‚à™ {q c }
				let Œ¥ 0 = Œ¥ ‚à™ {(q, S) 7‚Üí q c }
				in explore (Q 0 , Œ¥ 0 , q c )

let explore (Q, Œ¥, q) = fold (goto q) (Q, Œ¥) (C(q))

fun mkDFA r =
	let q 0 = ‚àÇ Œµ r
	let (Q, Œ¥) = explore ({q 0 }, {}, q 0 )
	let F = {q | q ‚àà Q and ŒΩ(q) = Œµ}
	in hQ, q 0 , F, Œ¥i
